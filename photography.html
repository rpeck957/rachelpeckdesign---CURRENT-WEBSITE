        <div id="phototext" class="text">
          <h2>Buffalo's Renaissance – 2016</h2>
          <p>Buffalo is a place that has been forgotten in the past. Through the association of abandonment and desolation, people are quick to discount our city. But these associations no longer define us and those of us lucky enough to call it home are witnessing a renaissance.</p>
          <p>The rich history from Buffalo’s golden age has caused beautiful treasures to remain and endure the years of hardship. These timeless beauties continue to inspire those in the community to work hard to revitalize a city that was once one of the world’s greatest. In the past few years, efforts have been made to attract people to Buffalo. Everyday, there is a new project to restore the city to its glory or create something new and exciting. Beauty exists in so many forms here, among both the new and the old. Buffalo is no longer a place that people forget about, in fact, it is a place that a lot of people are talking about. People are starting to realize how good life can be in Buffalo and choosing to put roots down in the Queen City rather than other competing cities, like New York.</p>
          <p>Buffalo is a place that I will never get tired of exploring. Every day I happen upon an undiscovered treasure that the city has to offer. I am incredibly lucky to have been able to witness so much progress in a few short years and the future holds infinite possibilities that I cannot wait to be a part of. As a person that used to see her future as anywhere but here, I am proud to admit that Buffalo has completely changed my views and has now become the place where I know I will always want to be.</p>

          <h2>Hillview Helpers – 2016</h2>
          <p>Too often we find ourselves consumed by the stressful, hectic natures of our lives. Work, deadlines, money and all of life’s “What ifs?” consume our minds. We forget that once we were small children that saw all of the possibility and wonder in the world. Life was a beautiful adventure full of endless possibilities ahead. Though, children may have it harder than we do. Their main concern is learning the very fundamentals of life including reading, writing, math, etc,. Somehow, while faced with such monumentally important tasks, they are able to experience pure joy from simple things and remain infinitely optimistic and full of imagination.</p>
          <p>It is our job as the adults in children’s lives to embrace them, encourage them and do everything in our power to help them to grow. This is especially true for a teacher. Teachers are essential in a child’s development and the influence they have is immeasurable. I had the privilege to play a small role in a group of children’s lives these past few weeks. This series of photos was taken alongside service work in a special education classroom in Hillview Elementary School in Lancaster, NY. There, I was able to interact with the children, assist the teacher in her tremendous job and experience the mindset that these children possess. In a time in my life where stress is all consuming, it was so refreshing to see the world through a child’s beautiful, optimistic eyes.</p>
