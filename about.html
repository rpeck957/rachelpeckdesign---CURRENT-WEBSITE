I’ve always been very persistent and I truly believe that there are no design challenges that cannot be solved.

                <h3>Designer</h3>
                <p>I recently graduated from Canisius College at the top of my class, with a Bachelor of Science in Digital Media Arts. My concentration was always graphic design but I was able to pick up a web design concentration and several communication/advertising classes along the way. Unlike a typical design program, my education provided me with experience in various types of modern media. I was exposed to interaction design, motion graphics, videography, etc. in addition to the knowledge necessary to succeed as a designer. I am so grateful for this unique exposure, but I felt it was important to get a fine arts background as well. I minored in Studio Arts where I learned the basics of design, drawing, color theory and photography in studio classes. Less “I’s”</p>

                <p>I viewed my college years as the time to soak in as much knowledge as I possibly could in many different disciplines. I made sure to take advantage of every opportunity that presented itself. Though doing so meant some insanely long days, sleep deprivation, a second home in the design lab on campus and even taking multiple classes scheduled at the same time, I am so glad to have created such a well rounded education for myself. Having this wide foundation of knowledge and the expert insight from my professors under my belt helped to shape me into a confident designer with an effective eye and strong technical proficiency, ready to take on any challenge.

                <h3>Buffalonian</h3>
                <p>I am proud to be born and raised in Buffalo, NY. I loved growing up here among such a strong sense of community and pride that Buffalo possesses. Though I reside in the Village of Hamburg, the City of Buffalo provides a sense of comfort and nostalgia to me as well. I recently began to appreciate my hometown so much more as I have been able to watch it grow and thrive in the past few years. This beautiful city is re-emerging before my eyes and I am so lucky to be a part of its bright future.</p>
                <p>One of my goals as a designer is to use my creativity and training to contribute to the renaissance and growth of my hometown moving forward. I cannot wait to explore the opportunities that Buffalo has to offer.</p>

                <h3>City Lover</h3>
                <p>I love exploring new cities. My ideal day would be aimlessly wandering around a new city, no destination in sight but just exploring and taking in the culture that shapes it. As much as I love new cities, New York City will always be a favorite as it holds an incredibly special place in my heart. Spontaneous trips to New York are some of my favorite memories in my life.</p>
                <p>My love for cities reflects in my design aesthetic. I am inspired by urban elements, such as skylines, cityscapes and architectural elements.</p>

                  <li><p>Everything I own tends to be a variation of the blue color that you see on this website. It seems only fitting to extend my coincidentally/subconscious matching into my personal brand.</p></li>
                  <li><p>I grew up in a family that supported and instilled a love for music and theater. Some of my favorite memories of my childhood came from performing in musicals in school. My love for theater stuck with me into adulthood and remains an important part of my life. There is no feeling that compares to experiencing live theater, especially on Broadway.</p></li>
                  <li><p>I have a growing collection of Starbucks city mugs. I have accumulated over 30 mugs in the past 5 years as it has become a fun tradition for my friends and family. My collection sort of epitomizes me because it mixes my love for coffee, traveling and great design.</p></li>
